# ADR 0001: Initial architecture

## Status
Accepted â€” 2025-10-02

## Context
We needed a demonstrable version of FLZK that highlights engineering best
practices without shipping heavy cryptography stacks. Stakeholders value fast
iteration, reproducibility, and clear signals of project health.

## Decision
- Keep the simulation deterministic and dependency-light so CI stays fast.
- Present the simulator through FastAPI with Pydantic validation and typed
  dataclasses.
- Provide Streamlit/notebook touchpoints for non-engineer demos.
- Embed documentation, contribution guidelines, and workflows to mirror a team
  workflow (linting, tests, security scans, release automation).

## Consequences
- The simulator is not a drop-in replacement for production FLZK; future ADRs
  will be required to integrate real DP/zk-proof libraries.
- Deterministic output simplifies testing but does not cover stochastic model
  behaviour. Teams should add stochastic variants when needed.
- Documentation/CI footprint is larger than a quick script, but that overhead is
  intentional to exhibit mature engineering signals.
